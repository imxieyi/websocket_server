# AMT DrawBox WebSocket Server

This is a WebSocket Server developed for AMT image marking project.
It is developped under [Eclipse][1] Neon and [Tomcat][2] 9.0. In fact Tomcat 8.0+ is required. And it is strongly recommended that you should use a version of **Eclipse Java EE** instead of Eclipse Java SE.
A version of relational database system is needed. I used [Mysql][3] in developing. The sql file is a dump of my database.
